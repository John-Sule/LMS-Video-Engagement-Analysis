# 📊 LMS Video Engagement Analysis

This data science project analyzed learner engagement in a digital university setting using video interaction data.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 📈 **Exploratory Analysis**: Identified top-performing and high-abandonment videos
- 🧮 **Learner Scoring**: Developed custom engagement scores for ranking
- 🔄 **Churn Prediction**: Labeled disengaged learners and built a Logistic Regression model
- 🌐 **API Deployment**: Exposed churn model with FastAPI for real-time use
- 🔍 **Clustering & Anomaly Detection**: Segmented learner behavior and flagged unusual patterns
- 📉 **Dropout Alert System**: Identified learners with declining engagement over time
- 🌲 **Predictive Modeling**: Used Random Forest to predict completion likelihood

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib)
- FastAPI
- Jupyter Notebook
- SMOTE for class balancing
- K-Means for clustering
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- GitHub for versioning

## 📂 Structure

- `notebooks/` – Analysis notebooks for each task
- `main.py` – FastAPI app for churn prediction
- `churn_model.pkl` – Trained Logistic Regression model
- `README.md` – Project summary
- `report/` – Summary report and presentation materials

## 📌 Summary

This project demonstrates how data science can drive learner retention, adaptive support, and content optimization in an edtech platform.
